## 🚀 How to Run This Project - Online Coffee Store

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SomshekharArabali/STQA--Academic
```
(Note: The repository name still refers to 'BookStore', but the content of the app has changed.)

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

Open the project folder in VS Code, then run:

```bash
npm i
```

This will install all the required libraries to run the project.

### 3️⃣ Start the Website

Open the **index.html** file with **Live Server**.
If you don’t have the extension, install **Live Server** from the VS Code extensions tab.

You can start it in two ways:

*   **Right-click → “Open with Live Server”**, or
*   **Press `Alt + L + O`** (shortcut)

> ⚠️ Make sure Live Server runs on **Google Chrome**, otherwise some test cases might fail.

### 4️⃣ Run the Test Cases

In the terminal, type:

```bash
npm test
```

A new **Chrome window** will open automatically, and the test cases will start running.

Once done, the terminal will show how many test cases **passed** and **failed**.
